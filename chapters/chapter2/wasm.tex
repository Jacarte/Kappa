\msection{\Wasm}
\label{sota:wasm}
%% For the intro
 % In 2014, Alon Zakai and colleagues proposed Emscripten \cite{emscripten}. 
% Emscripten used a strict subset of JavaScript, asm.js, to allow low-level code such as C to be compiled to JavaScript. 
% Asm.js was faster than JavaScript because it limited the language features to those that can be optimized in the LLVM pipeline. 
% Notably, Asm.js demonstrated that client-code could be improved with the right language design and standardization.
% Wasm marked the breaking point of several failed attempts of porting code but JavaScript to the web browser \cite{javaapplet,activex,silverlight}.
% Previous alternatives largely failed to gain traction, primarily due to security concerns and a lack of consensus among browser vendors.
% The announcement of \wasm\ marked the first step into the standardization of bytecode in the web environment. 

% History
The W3C publicly announced the \Wasm(Wasm) language in 2017 as the fourth scripting language supported in all major web browser vendors.
\wasm\ is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine and was officially consolidated by the work of Haas \etal \cite{Haas_2017} in 2017 and extended by Rossberg \etal in 2018 \cite{10.1145/3282510}. 
It is designed to be fast, portable, self-contained and secure, and it outperforms JavaScript execution. 
Since 2017, the adoption of \wasm\ keeps growing. 
For example; Adobe, announced a full online version of Photoshop\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/Adobe/status/1453034805004685313?s=20&t=Zf1N7-WmzecA0K4V8R69lw}} written in WebAssembly;  game companies moved their development from JavaScript to Wasm like is the case of a full Minecraft version\footnote{\url{https://satoshinm.github.io/NetCraft/}}. 

Moreover, WebAssembly has been evolving outside web browsers since its first announcement.
Some works demonstrated that using WebAssembly as an intermediate layer is better in terms of startup and memory usage than containerization and virtualization \cite{pMendkiServerless, 1244493Jacobsson}. 
Consequently, in 2019, the Bytecodealliance proposed WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) \cite{WASI}. 
WASI pioneered the execution of \wasm\ with a POSIX system interface protocol, making it possible to execute Wasm closer to the underlying operating system. 
Therefore, it standardizes the adoption of \wasm\ in heterogeneous platforms \cite{bryant2020webassembly}, making it suitable for standalone and backend execution scenarios \cite{9640153, wen2020wasmachine}.

\msubsection{From source code to \Wasm}

\Wasm programs are compiled from source languages like C/C++, Rust, or Go, which means that it can benefit from the optimizations of the source language compiler.
The resulting \wasm program is like a traditional shared library, containing instruction codes, symbols, and exported functions. 
A host environment is in charge of complementing the Wasm program, such as providing external functions required for execution within the host engine. 
For instance, functions for interacting with an HTML page's DOM are imported into the Wasm binary when invoked from JavaScript code in the browser. 


In \autoref{CExample1} and \autoref{WASMExample}, we present a C program alongside its corresponding WebAssembly binary. 
The C function encompasses various elements such as heap allocation, external function usage, and a function definition that includes a loop, conditional branching, function calls, and memory accesses.
The Wasm code shown in \autoref{WASMExample} is displayed in its textual format, known as WAT\footnote{The WAT text format is primarily designed for human readability and for low-level manual editing.}.
The static memory declared in line 2 of \autoref{CExample1} is allocated within the Wasm binary's linear memory, as illustrated in line 47 of \autoref{WASMExample}.
The function declared in line 5 of \autoref{CExample1} is converted into an imported function, as seen in line 8 of \autoref{WASMExample}.
The main function, spanning lines 7 to 14 in \autoref{CExample1}, is transcribed into a Wasm function covering lines 12 to 38 in \autoref{WASMExample}. Within this function, the translation of various C language constructs into Wasm can be observed.
For instance, the \texttt{for} loop found in line 8 of \autoref{CExample1} is mapped to a block structure in lines 17 to 31 of \autoref{WASMExample}. 
The loop's breaking condition is converted into a conditional branch, as shown in line 25 of \autoref{WASMExample}.

\input{chapters/chapter2/wasm_example}


There exist several compilers that turn source code into \Wasm binaries. 
For example, LLVM has offered \Wasm as a backend option since its 7.1.0 release\toolcite{https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-7.1.0}, supporting a diverse set of frontend languages like C/C++, Rust, Go, and AssemblyScript\footnote{A subset of the TypeScript language}.
Significantly, a study by Hilbig et al. reveals that 70\% of \Wasm binaries are generated using LLVM-based compilers. 
The main advantage of using LLVM is that it provides a common optimization infrastructure for \Wasm binaries.
In parallel developments, the KMM framework\toolcite{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html} has incorporated \Wasm as a compilation target.


A recent trend in the \Wasm ecosystem involves porting various programming languages by converting both the language's engine or interpreter and the source code into a \Wasm program. 
For example, Javy\toolcite{https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy} encapsulates JavaScript code within the QuickJS interpreter, demonstrating that direct source code conversion to \Wasm isn't always required. 
If an interpreter for a specific language can be compiled to \Wasm, it allows for the bundling of both the interpreter and the language into a single, isolated \Wasm binary. 
Similarly, Blazor\toolcite{https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor} facilitates the execution of .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) in \Wasm binaries for browser-based applications. 
However, this approach is still non-mature and faces challenges, such as the absence of JIT compilation for the "interpreted" code, making it less suitable for long-running tasks \cite{10.1145/3593434.3593454}. 
On the other hand, it proves effective for short-running tasks, particularly those executed in Edge-Cloud computing platforms.

\msubsection{\Wasm's binary format}
\label{background:wasm:binary}

The Wasm binary format is close to machine code and already optimized, being a consecutive collection of sections.
In \autoref{background:wasm:fig:section} we show the binary format of a Wasm section.
A Wasm section starts with a 1-byte section ID, followed by a 4-byte section size, and concludes with the section content, which precisely matches the size indicated earlier.
A \wasm binary contains sections of 13 types, each with a specific semantic role and placement within the module. 
For instance, the \emph{Custom Section} stores metadata like the compiler used to generate the binary, while the \emph{Type Section} contains function signatures that serve to validate the \emph{Function Section}. 
The \emph{Import Section} lists elements imported from the host, and the \emph{Function Section} details the functions defined within the binary. 
Other sections like \emph{Table, Memory, and Global Sections} specify the structure for indirect calls, unmanaged linear memories, and global variables, respectively. 
\emph{Export, Start, Element, Code, Data, and Data Count Sections} handle aspects ranging from declaring elements for host engine access to initializing program state, declaring bytecode instructions per function, and initializing linear memory. 
Each of these sections must occur only once in a binary and can be empty, i.e., they can be empty.
For the sake of understanding, we also annotate sections as comments in the Wasm code in \autoref{WASMExample}.
    

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/section.pdf}
    \caption{Memory byte representation of a \Wasm binary section, starting with a 1-byte section ID, followed by an 8-byte section size, and finally the section content.}
    \label{background:wasm:fig:section}
\end{figure}

Due to its organization into a contiguous array of sections, a \wasm binary can be processed efficiently. 
For example, this structure allows compilers to speed up the compilation process through parallel parsing or just by ignoring \emph{Custom Sections}.
Additionally, the use of the LEB128\toolcite{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128} encoding of instructions of the \emph{Code Section} further compacts the binary. 
As a result, Wasm binaries are not only fast to validate and compile but also quick to transmit over a network.

\msubsection{\Wasm's runtime}
\label{background:wasm:execution}



During runtime, \Wasm engines instantiate a \Wasm module, which is a runtime representation of a loaded and initialized \Wasm binary (the binary file described in \autoref{background:wasm:binary}). 
The key component of a module instance is its Execution Stack.
The Execution Stack holds typed values, labels and control frames, with labels handling block instructions, loops, and function calls.
Values inside the stack can be of the only static types allowed in Wasm 1.0, \texttt{i32} for 32 bits signed integer, \texttt{i64} for 64 bits signed integer, \texttt{f32} for 32 bits float and \texttt{f64} for 64 bits float.
Therefore, abstract types, such as classes, objects, and arrays, are not natively supported. 
Instead, during compilation, such types are transformed into primitive types and stored in the linear memory.

At runtime, \Wasm functions are closures over the runtime module instance.
A function groups locals and a function body.
Locals are typed variables that are local to a specific function invocation as previously discussed.
The function body is a sequence of instructions that are executed when the function is called.
Each instruction either reads from the stack, writes to the stack, or modifies the control flow of the function.
Recalling the example \wasm binary previously showed, 
% Functions
the local variable declarations and typed instructions that are evaluated using the stack can be appreciated between Line 7 and Line 32 in \autoref{WASMExample}. 
Each instruction reads its operands from the stack and pushes back the result. 
In the case of \autoref{WASMExample}, the result value of the main function is the calculation of the last instruction, \texttt{i32.add}. 
As the listing also shows, instructions are annotated with a numeric type.

A WebAssembly module instance encapsulates three types of memory-related instances.
First, it might include several linear memory instances, which are a contiguous array of bytes.
Memory instances are accessed with \texttt{i32} pointers (integer of 32 bits). 
Memory instances are only shareable between the process that instantiates the \Wasm module and the binary itself.
Linear memories can be operated by both, the engine and the \Wasm runtime instance.
Second, global instances, which are variables with values and mutability flags, indicating whether the global can be modified or is immutable.
Global variables are managed by the host engine, i.e., their allocation and memory placement are managed by the host engine.
Global variables are only accessible by their declaration index, and it is not possible to dynamically address them. 
Third, and similar to globals, locals are mutable variables that are local to a specific function instance, i.e. locals are only accessible through their index related to the executing function instance. 
As globals, locals are part of the managed data.


\wrule{Browser} engines like V8\toolcite{https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git} and SpiderMonkey\toolcite{https://spidermonkey.dev/} are at the forefront of executing \Wasm binaries in browser clients. 
These engines leverage Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers to convert \Wasm into machine code. 
This translation is typically a straightforward one-to-one mapping, given that \Wasm is already an optimized format closely aligned with machine code, as previously discussed in \autoref{background:wasm:binary}. 
For example, V8 just employs quick, rudimentary optimizations, such as constant folding and dead code removal, to guarantee fast readiness for a \wasm binary to execute \cite{10.1145/3282510}.

\wrule{Standalone engines:} \wasm has expanded beyond browser environments, largely due to the WASI\cite{WASI}. 
It standardizes the interactions between host environments and \Wasm modules through a POSIX-like interface.
\wasm compilers can generate binaries that use WASI.
Standalone engines can then execute these binaries in a variety of environments, including cloud, server, and IoT devices.
For example, standalone engines like WASM3\toolcite{https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3}, Wasmer\toolcite{https://wasmer.io/}, Wasmtime\toolcite{https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime}, WAVM\toolcite{https://github.com/WAVM/WAVM}, and Sledge\cite{Sledge} have emerged to support \Wasm and WASI. 
In a similar vein, Singh et al.\cite{WARDuino2019} introduced a virtual machine for \Wasm tailored for Arduino-based devices. 
Salim et al.\cite{trufflewasm} proposed TruffleWasm, an implementation of \Wasm hosted on Truffle and GraalVM. 
Additionally, SWAM\toolcite{https://github.com/satabin/swam} stands out as \Wasm interpreter implemented in Scala. 
Finally, WaVe\cite{wave} offers a \Wasm interpreter featuring mechanized verification of the \Wasm-WASI interaction with the underlying operating system.


\msubsection{\Wasm's control flow}

In \Wasm, a defined function instructions are organized into blocks, with the function's starting point serving as the root block. 
Unlike traditional assembly code, control flow structures in Wasm jump between block boundaries rather than arbitrary positions within the code. 
Each block might specify the required stack state before execution and the resulting stack state after its instructions have run. 
This stack state is used to validate the binary during compilation and to ensure that the stack is in a valid state before executing the block's instructions.
Blocks in Wasm are explicit, indicating, where they start and end.
By design, each block cannot reference or execute code from outer blocks.

At runtime, each break instruction is limited to jumping to one of its enclosing blocks.
%Loops in Wasm are specialized blocks that can be restarted using a break instruction. 
Excepting loop constructions, breaks jump to the end of the block, effectively continuing to the next immediate instruction.
Within a loop, block ends jump to the block's beginning, effectively restarting the loop.   
To illustrate this, \autoref{background:wasm:block} provides an example comparing a standard block and a loop block in a Wasm function.

\input{snippets/jumps.tex}

Each break instruction includes the depth of the enclosing block as an operand. 
This depth is used to identify the target block for the break instruction. 
For example, in the left-most part of the previously discussed listing, a break instruction with a depth of 1 would jump past two enclosing blocks.
This design hardens the rewriting of \wasm binaries.
For instance, if a block is removed, the depth of the break instructions within the block must be updated to reflect the new enclosing block depth.
This is a significant challenge for rewriting tools, as it requires the analysis of the control flow graph to determine the enclosing block depth for each break instruction.

\msubsection{WebAssembly's binary analysis}
\label{background:wasm:analysis}
As the WebAssembly ecosystem continues to grow, the need for robust tools to ensure its security and reliability has increased. 
To address this, a variety of tools have been developed that employ different strategies to identify vulnerabilities in \Wasm programs. 
In the following we provide a brief overview of the most relevant tools in this space w.r.t static and dynamic analysis, as well as specialized malware detection.

%% PATCH
\vspace{10mm}
\wrule{Static and dynamic analysis:} 
Tools like Wassail\cite{wassail}, SecWasm\cite{secwasm}, Wasmati\cite{wasmati}, and Wasp\cite{Wasp} leverage techniques such as information flow control, code property graphs, control flow analysis, and concolic execution to detect vulnerabilities in \wasm binaries. 
Remarkably, VeriWasm\cite{veriwasm} stands out as a static offline verifier specifically designed for native x86-64 binaries compiled from \Wasm. 
In the dynamic analysis counterpart, tools like TaintAssembly\cite{taintassembly}, Wasabi\cite{wasabi}, and Fuzzm\cite{fuzzm} offer similar functionalities in vulnerability detection. 
Stiévenart and colleagues have introduced a dynamic approach to slice \Wasm programs based on Observational-Based Slicing (ORBS)\cite{slicing, slicing2}. 
Hybrid methods have also gained traction, with tools like CT-Wasm\cite{ctwasm} enabling the verifiably secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms in \Wasm. 
% Finally, Wafl\cite{wafl} extends AFL++ to perform coverage-based fuzzing on \Wasm binaries.


\wrule{Specialized Malware Detection:} Cryptomalware have a wide presence in the web since the first days of \wasm.
The main reason is that mining algorithms using CPUs moved to \wasm for obvious performance reasons \cite{musch2019new}. 
In cryptomalware detection, tools like MineSweeper\cite{Minesweeper}, MinerRay\cite{MinerRay}, and MINOS\cite{MINOS} utilize static analysis through machine learning techniques to detect browser cryptomalwares. 
Conversely, tools like SEISMIC\cite{SEISMIC}, RAPID\cite{RAPID}, and OUTGuard\cite{outguard} seek the same goal with dynamic analysis techniques.
Remarkably, VirusTotal\toolcite{https://www.virustotal.com}, packaging more than 60 commercial antivirus as back-boxes, detects cryptomalware in \wasm binaries.


\msubsection{\Wasm's security}

From a security standpoint, \Wasm programs are designed without a standard library and are prohibited from direct interactions with the operating system. Instead, the host environment offers a predefined set of functions that can be imported into the \Wasm program. 
It falls upon the compilers to specify which functions from the host environment will be imported by the \Wasm application.


While \Wasm is engineered to be deterministic, well-typed, and to adhere to a structured control flow, the ecosystem is still emerging and faces various security vulnerabilities. 
These vulnerabilities pose risks to both the consumers and the \Wasm binaries themselves. 
Side-channel attacks, in particular, are a significant concern. 
For example, Genkin et al. have shown that \Wasm can be exploited to exfiltrate data through cache timing-side channels \cite{Genkin2018DrivebyKC}. 
Similarly, research by Maisuradze and Rossow demonstrates the feasibility of speculative execution attacks on \Wasm binaries \cite{ret2spec}. 
Rokicki \etal further reveal the potential for port contention side-channel attacks on \Wasm binaries in browsers \cite{10.1145/3488932.3517411}.
Additionally, studies by Lehmann et al. and Stiévenart and colleagues indicate that vulnerabilities in C/C++ source code can propagate into \Wasm binaries \cite{usenixWasm2020, DeRoover2022}. 
This dissertation introduces a comprehensive set of tools aimed at preemptively enhancing \Wasm security through Software Diversification.
