\section*{Conclusions}

In this chapter, we discuss two sides of Software Diversification as applied to \Wasm: Offensive Software Diversification and Defensive Software Diversification.
Offensive Software Diversification underscores both the capabilities and the latent security risks inherent in applying Software Diversification to \Wasm malware.
Our research indicates that there are ways for enhancing the automated detection of cryptojacking malware in WebAssembly, e.g. by stressing their resilience with \Wasm malware variants.
On the other hand, Defensive Software Diversification acts as a preemptive safeguard, specifically to mitigate the risks posed by Spectre attacks.

While we did not cover all possible scenarios for the use of our tools, we have experimented with other use cases. 
For example, CROW excels at generating \Wasm variants that reduce noise in side-channels, thus strengthening against potential attacks. 
Conversely, the deployment of multivariants out of MEWE can prevent high-level timing-based side-channels \cite{morgan2015web}. 
Specifically, we have experimented with the round-trip times of the generated multivariants and concluded that, at a high level, variants cannot be discriminated by collecting this timing side-channel information. 
In the following chapter, we will consolidate the main conclusions of this dissertation and outline directions for future research.
