\section*{Conclusions}

In this chapter, we discuss two sides of Software Diversification as applied to \Wasm: Offensive Software Diversification and Defensive Software Diversification.
Offensive Software Diversification underscores both the capabilities and the latent security risks inherent in applying Software Diversification to \Wasm malware.
Our research indicates that there are ways for enhancing the automated detection of cryptojacking malware in WebAssembly, e.g. by stressing their resilience with \Wasm malware variants.
On the other hand, Defensive Software Diversification acts as a preemptive safeguard, specifically to mitigate the risks posed by Spectre attacks.
In the subsequent chapter, we will consolidate the principal conclusions of this dissertation and describe directions for future research.
