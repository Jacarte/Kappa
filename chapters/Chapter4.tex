\chapter{Exploiting Software Diversification for \Wasm}
\label{exploit}

In this chapter we instantiate the usage of Software Diversification for offensive and defensive purposes.
We present two selected use cases that exploit Software Diversification through our technical contributions presented in \autoref{tech}.
The selected cases are representative of applications of Software Diversification for \Wasm in browsers and standalone engines.

\msection{Conclusions}

In this chapter we present two use of cases for Software Diversification in \Wasm.
We present a case of Offensive Software Diversification and a case of Defensive Software Diversification.
While the name of Offensive Software Diversification might seem counterproductive, it is important to note that the goal of this work is to highlight the potential of Software Diversification for \Wasm and to raise awareness of the security implications of \Wasm.
The latter highlights that Software Diversification can be used to protect \Wasm programs from malicious actors, specially from Spectre attacks.
In the next chapter we present the conclusions of this dissertation and future work.
