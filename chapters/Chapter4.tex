\chapter{Exploiting Software Diversification for \Wasm}
\label{exploit}
\lettrine[lines=4]{I}{n} this chapter, we illustrate the application of Software Diversification for both offensive and defensive purposes.
We discuss two selected use cases that demonstrate our technical contributions to Software Diversification, as presented in \autoref{tech}.
These cases exemplify applications of Software Diversification for \Wasm in both browser and standalone engines.

\section*{Conclusions}

In this chapter, we discuss two sides of Software Diversification as applied to \Wasm: Offensive Software Diversification and Defensive Software Diversification.
The term \emph{Offensive Software Diversification} may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but its role is to underscore both the capabilities and the latent security risks inherent in applying Software Diversification to \Wasm.
Our research indicates that there are ways for enhancing the automated detection of cryptojacking malware in WebAssembly, e.g. by testing their resilience with \Wasm malware variants.
On the other hand, Defensive Software Diversification acts as a preemptive safeguard, specifically to mitigate the risks posed by Spectre attacks.
In the subsequent chapter, we will consolidate the principal conclusions of this dissertation and describe directions for future research.
