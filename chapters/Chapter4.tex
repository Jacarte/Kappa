\lettrine[lines=3]{I}{n} this chapter, we illustrate the application of Software Diversification for both offensive and defensive purposes.
We discuss two selected use cases that demonstrate the practical applications of our contributions.
Additionally, we discuss the challenges and benefits arising from the application of Software Diversification to \Wasm.

\section*{Conclusions}
In this chapter, we explore Offensive and Defensive Software Diversification applied to \Wasm.
Offensive Software Diversification highlights both the potential and the latent security risks in applying Software Diversification to \Wasm malware. 
Our findings suggest potential enhancements to the automatic detection of cryptojacking malware in WebAssembly, e.g., by stressing their resilience with \Wasm malware variants. 
Conversely, Defensive Software Diversification serves as a proactive guard, specifically designed to mitigate the risks associated with Spectre attacks. 

Moreover, we have conducted experiments with various use cases that are not shown in this chapter.
For instance, CROW \cite{CROW} excels in generating \Wasm variants that minimize side-channel noise, thereby bolstering defenses against potential side-channel attacks. 
Alternatively, deploying multivariants from MEWE \cite{MEWE} can thwart high-level timing-based side-channels \cite{morgan2015web}. 
Specifically, we conducted experiments on the round-trip times of the generated multivariants and concluded that, at a high level, the timing side-channel information cannot discriminate between variants.
