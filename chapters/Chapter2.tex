\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{his} chapter discusses the state-of-the-art in the areas of \Wasm and Software Diversification. 
In \autoref{sota:wasm} we discuss \Wasm, focusing on its design and security model.
Besides, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of \Wasm research.
In \autoref{sota:sw} we discuss related works in the area of Software Diversification.
Moreover, we delve into the open challenges regarding the diversification of \Wasm programs.

%\section{Contributions of this thesis to Software Diversification for \Wasm}

\section*{Conclusions}

In this chapter, we presented an overview of the Wasm language. 
This included its binary format, runtime execution concepts, and security issues. 
Related work was also discussed. 
The goal of this chapter is to establish a foundation for studying automatic diversification in Wasm. 
We emphasized the fact that Wasm has not been extensively researched in the field of Artificial Software Diversification. 
Existing implementations for Software Diversification cannot be directly applied to Wasm. 
Current security limitations and the absence of software diversity approaches for Wasm inspire our work. 
In \autoref{tech}, we elaborate on the technical details that guide our contributions.
