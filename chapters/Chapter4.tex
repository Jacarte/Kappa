\chapter{Exploiting Software Diversification for \Wasm}
\label{exploit}

The subsequent text serves to bridge theory with practice, showcasing the tangible impacts and benefits of using CROW, MEWE, and WASM-MUTATE.
In this chapter, we present two selected use cases that exploit Software Diversification through our technical contributions presented in \autoref{tech}.
The selected cases are representative of applications of Software Diversification for \Wasm in browsers and standalone engines.
Besides, we select the cases based on their impact and novelty.
