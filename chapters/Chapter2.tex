\chapter{Background and state of the art}
\label{SOTA}

This chapter provides an analysis of \emph{\Wasm} and delves into the current state-of-the-art in \emph{Software Diversification}. 
Within \autoref{sota:wasm}, we explore various facets of the \Wasm language, including its underlying motivations, the process for generating \Wasm binaries, its binary specification, the broader ecosystem, and pertinent security considerations. 
Subsequently, in \autoref{sota:sota}, we offer an overview of Software Diversification, elucidating its foundational concepts and seminal works in the field, which have been selected based on their innovative contributions, critical insights, and the representativeness of their techniques.
