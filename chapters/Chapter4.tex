\chapter{Exploiting Software Diversification for \Wasm}
\label{method}

\msection{WASM-MUTATE \Wasm malware evasion}

\todo{The malware evasion paper}

\msubsection{Objective}

Test and evade the resilience of \Wasm malware detectors mentioned in \autoref{background:wasm:ecosystems}.

\msubsection{Approach}

\todo{We use wasm-mutate}
\todo{How do we use it?}
\todo{Controlled and uncontrolled diversification.}

\msubsection{Results}



\msubsection{CROW: Automatic testing and fuzzing of \Wasm consumers}

\todo{We explain the CVE. Make the explanation around "indirect memory diversification"}

\msubsection{Objective}

Test compilers, interpreters, and runtimes for \Wasm.
In concrete wasmtime.

Make the history around the CVE.


\msubsection{Approach}

Use CROW to generate a set of \wasm binaries.

\msubsection{Results}

The CVE and the indirect memory diversification.
This is a big insight.

\msection{MEWE: Multivariant execution at the Edge}
\label{usecasetime}

\todo{Disturbing of execution time. Go around the web timing attacks.}
 Attack model for MEWE.


\msubsection{Threat model}
- Software monoculture

- Timing based attacks. Mentioned the Whitehat paper, mention the \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10523.pdf} paper. 


\msubsection{Approach}

- Use of MEWE



\msubsection{Results}

- Unpredictable variant given the execution time.

\msection{WASM-MUTATE: Speculative Side-channel protection}

\todo{Go around the last paper}

\msubsection{Threat model}


- Spectre timing cache attacks.

- Rockiki paper on portable side channel in browsers.


\msubsection{Approach}

- Use of wasm-mutate

\msubsection{Results}

- Diminshing of BER
