\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he} first web browser, Nexus, made its appearance in 1990 \cite{nexus}. 
At its inception, web browsing consisted solely of retrieving and displaying small, static textual web pages. 
In simpler terms, users could only read page content without any interactive components. 
However, the escalating computing power of devices, the proliferation of the internet, the valuation of internet based companies and the demand for more engaging user experiences birthed the concept of executing code in conjunction with web pages. 
In 1995, the Netscape browser revolutionized this concept by introducing JavaScript \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_7}, a language that allowed code execution on the client-side.
Interactive web content immediately highlighted benefits: unlike classical native software, web applications do not require installation, are always up-to-date, and are accessible from any device with a web browser. 
Significantly, since the advent of Netscape, all browsers have offered JavaScript support. 
In the present day, the majority of web pages incorporate not only HTML but also JavaScript code, which is executed on client computers. 
Over the past several decades, web browsers have metamorphosed into JavaScript language virtual machines. 
They have evolved into intricate systems capable of running comprehensive applications, such as video and audio players, animation creators, and PDF document renderers, like the one displaying this document.

JavaScript is presently the most widely utilized scripting language in all contemporary web browsers \cite{mulazzani2013fast}.
However, it is not without limitations due to the inherent characteristics of the language.
For instance, each JavaScript engine necessitates the parsing and recompiling of the JavaScript code, resulting in substantial overhead.
In fact, just parsing and compiling JavaScript code consume the majority of the load times of websites \cite{clark}.
In addition to performance limitations, JavaScript also has security concerns \cite{10.1145/1190216.1190252}.
A notable example of this is the lack of memory isolation in JavaScript, which allows extraction of information from other processes \cite{10.1145/3412841.3442001}.
These issues led the Web Consortium (W3C) to standardize a bytecode for the web environment in 2015, which is the \Wasm(Wasm) language.
Hence, \Wasm became the fourth official language for the web.

\msection{\Wasm}

\Wasm was designed with a focus on speed, portability, self-containment, and security \cite{Haas_2017}.
It allows for all programs to be compiled ahead-of-time from source languages like C/C++ and Rust.
Third-party compilers create \Wasm binaries, potentially including optimizations, as in the case of LLVM.
The Wasm language defines its Instruction Set Architecture as an abstraction, similar to machine code instructions but independent of CPU architectures \cite{wasm_spec}.
This design allows web browsers to compile quickly to target architectures through a fast, one-to-one translation process.

The versatility of WebAssembly extends not just to web browsers, but to backend scenarios as well. 
Previous research has demonstrated the advantages of utilizing WebAssembly as an intermediary layer, noting improved startup times and more efficient memory usage when compared to containerization and virtualization \cite{pMendkiServerless, 1244493Jacobsson}. 
In response to these findings, the Bytecode Alliance introduced the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) in 2019 \cite{bytecodealliance, WASI}. 
WASI facilitated the execution of \wasm\ with a POSIX system interface protocol, thus enabling the direct execution of Wasm in the operating system. 
To underline the significance of this development, consider the words of Solomon Hykes, the former CEO of Docker, in a tweet about \Wasm and WASI:

\vspace{5mm}
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
	%\centering	
	\emph{If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task! \cite{solomon}}

\end{minipage}
\vspace{5mm}

WebAssembly is praised for its security, especially for its design that prevents programs from accessing data beyond their own memory. 
However, there has been less focus on potential vulnerabilities and attacks within WebAssembly's own memory \cite{usenixWasm2020}.
In addition, WebAssembly binaries may be inherently vulnerable due to flaws in their source code \cite{DeRoover2022}. 
There are also significant risks from side-channel attacks, as demonstrated by various researchers \cite{ret2spec, 10.1145/3488932.3517411, Swivel}. 
These vulnerabilities are not limited to the web browser environment, as WebAssembly is also used in the backend.
Yet, existing WebAssembly research mostly reacts to existing vulnerabilities, leaving the potential for unidentified attacks. 
In this dissertation, we propose a proactive approach to enhance WebAssembly security through Software Diversification.

\msection{Software Diversification}


Software Diversification is the process of finding, creating, and deploying program variants of a given original program \cite{okhravi2013survey} for the sake of security.
Cohen \etal \cite{cohen1993operating} and Forrest \etal \cite{595185} pioneered this field by proposing software diversification through code transformations. 
They proposed to produce variants of programs while preserving their functionalities, aiming to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Since then, transformations aiming at reducing the predictability of observable behavior of programs have been proposed. For example, works on this direction proposed to diversify programs control flow \cite{davi2015isomeron}, instruction set \cite{barrantes2003randomized}, or the system calls they use \cite{Chew02mitigatingbuffer}. 
Several of these transformations can be combined to produce less predictable variants.

While previous works on software diversification demonstrated the removal of vulnerabilities, in all cases, it can be used as a preemptive solution.
For example, if a vulnerability is present in one program variant, discovering and disseminating it will not affect other variants.
Software diversification has been widely researched, yet, the field does not study its application to \Wasm.

This dissertation presents toolsets, approaches and methodologies designed to enhance \Wasm security proactively through Software Diversification.
First, Software Diversification could expand the capabilities of already settled \Wasm analysis tools by incorporating diversified program variants, making it more challenging for attackers to exploit any missed vulnerabilities.
Generated as proactive security, these diversified variants can simulate a broader set of real-world conditions, thereby making \Wasm analysis tools more accurate. 
Second, we noted that current solutions to mitigate side-channel attacks on \Wasm binaries are either specific to certain attacks or need the modification of runtimes.
Software Diversification could mitigate yet-unknown vulnerabilities on \Wasm binaries by generating diversified variants in a platform-agnostic manner.

\msection{Problem statement}

Web browsers and JavaScript have nearly three decades of development.
Since then, web browsers have grown, reaching several implementations \cite{grosskurth2005reference, GARCES2021111004}. 
Nevertheless, only Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge dominate on user computers.
This means that, for 5 arbitrary devices (computers, tablets, smartphones) in a world of millions, at least two of them use the same web browser.
This highlights a software monoculture problem \cite{goth2003addressing}, as an ecosystem of machines running the exact same software. 
The monoculture concept is an analogy from biology \cite{lala2009monoculture}. 
It describes an ecosystem that faces extinction due the lack of diversity as all individuals share the exact same vulnerabilities.
In other words, many applications can crash due to a single shared vulnerability.

Nowadays, the serving of web pages, including WebAssembly code, is centralized and provided through main servers \cite{STRAC}.
Thus, a similar argument for software monoculture can be used for the Wasm code that is served to web browsers. 
Despite being designed for sandboxing and secure execution, \wasm\ is not exempt from vulnerabilities \cite{WebAssemblySecurity}.
For example, \wasm\ engines are vulnerable to speculative execution \cite{Narayan2021Swivel}, and C/C++ source code vulnerabilities might be ported to Wasm binaries \cite{DeRoover2022}.  
Therefore, the sharing of the \wasm\ code through web browsers, also includes \wasm\ vulnerabilities.


% Escalating
The software monoculture problem escalates if we consider the edge-cloud computing platforms and how they are adopting \Wasm to provide services, as we previously mentioned.
Concretely, along with browser clients, thousands of edge devices running Wasm as backend services might be affected due to vulnerabilities sharing.
This means that if one node in an edge network is vulnerable, all the others are vulnerable in the exact same manner as the same binary is replicated on each node. 
In other words, the same attacker payload would break all edge nodes at oncem a single distributed Wasm binary could unleash a worldwide catasthrophe.

One might think that the solution is to adopt more web browser and interpreters implementations. 
However, this is virtually impossible as 4 web browsers dominate the market and edge-cloud computing platforms are transparently executed in the backend.
Thus, a solution in this direction is doomed to fail. 
Another solution is to provide different WebAssembly codes.
For example, a different source code, yet equivalent, can be provided when a web page requests it \cite{CROW}. 
Consequently, millions of computers would execute different codes even though they use the same web browser.
This strategy is called Software Diversification.

	\wrule{Summary:} 
	In this paper, we synthesize functionally equivalent variants of a deployed edge service. 
	These variants are encapsulated into a single multivariant WebAssembly binary, 
	When executing the service endpoint, a random variant is selected each time a function is invoked.
	Execution of these multivariant binaries occurs on the global edge platform provided by Fastly, as part of a research collaboration. 
	We demonstrate that these multivariant binaries present a diverse range of execution traces throughout the entire edge platform, distributed worldwide, effectively creating a moving target defense.

	This paper introduces WASM-MUTATE, a compiler-agnostic WebAssembly diversification engine. 
	The engine is designed to swiftly generate semantically equivalent yet behaviorally diverse WebAssembly variants by leveraging an e-graph. 
	We show that WASM-MUTATE can generate tens of thousands of unique WebAssembly variants in mere minutes. 
	Importantly, WASM-MUTATE can safeguard WebAssembly binaries from timing side-channel attacks, such as Spectre.

	\wrule{Summary:}  \Wasm, while enhancing rich applications in browsers, also proves efficient in developing cryptojacking malware. 
	Protective measures against cryptomalware have not factored in the potential use of evasion techniques by attackers. 
	This paper delves into the potential of automatic binary diversification in aiding WebAssembly cryptojacking detectors' evasion. 
	We provide proof that our diversification tools can generate variants of WebAssembly cryptojacking that successfully evade VirusTotal and MINOS. 
	We further demonstrate that these generated variants introduce minimal performance overhead, thus verifying binary diversification as an effective evasion technique.
