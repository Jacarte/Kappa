\chapter{Exploiting Software Diversification for \Wasm}
\label{exploit}

In this chapter we instantiate the usage of Software Diversification for offensive and defensive purposes.
We present two selected use cases that exploit Software Diversification through our technical contributions presented in \autoref{tech}.
The selected cases are representative of applications of Software Diversification for \Wasm in browsers and standalone engines.
