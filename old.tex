    % Move the following
    Other solutions would have been to diversify at the source-code level or the \wasm\ binary level. However, these facts would limit the applicability of our work.
    Our approach is more general as diversification also will work for other LLVM backends.
    
    % Why and main change
    \todo{This is contradictory to our binary solution.}
    We use the superdiversifier idea of Jacob and colleagues to implement CROW because of two main reasons.
    First, the code replacements generated by this technique outperform diversification strategies based on handwritten rules . 
    Concretely, we can control the quality of the generated codes. 
    Besides, CROW always generates equivalent programs because it is based on a solver to check for equivalence. 
    Second, there is a battle-tested superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper \cite. 
    This latter makes it feasible the construction of a generic LLVM superdiversifier.

    Why is program analysis of WebAssembly binaries worthwhile in
particular? First, WebAssemblyâ€™s position as the low-level bytecode for
the Web makes it highly relevant today and more so in the future. If
proponents of WebAssembly are to be believed, it has the potential to
become a universal bytecode for applications outside the browser as
well. Figure 1.1 shows that WebAssembly is the common interchange
format between multiple source languages compiling to WebAssem-
bly and different host environments executing it. Developing program
analyses for each individual source language, or for each of the differ-
ent runtimes does not scale. When source code is not available, there
is also no choice but to analyze the WebAssembly bytecode directly

Second, as a novel code format, analyzing WebAssembly is rife with
open challenges and opportunities. When statically instrumenting WebAssembly binaries, the rewriting needs to be type-aware, otherwise the
resulting binaries are no longer valid. Other characteristics of WebAs-
sembly also need to be taken into account, e.g., structured control-flow
with relative branch labels. At the same time, WebAssembly is a saner
format for binary analysis and rewriting than native machine code.
Static disassembly of WebAssembly is robust, and built-in validation
helps with the reliability of static rewriting. We will discuss challenges
and opportunities around WebAssembly in more detail in Section 1.4.

Last but not least, we believe research should yield practical insights,
datasets, and (prototype) tools that are useful to developers and other
researchers to build on. Web developers so far are mostly used to high-
level JavaScript programs. With WebAssembly, e.g., compiled from C
and C++ code, they require new tooling and guidelines for dealing
with memory vulnerabilities, or to make sense of a binary without
source code. We discuss the conceptual contributions of our work in
Section 1.5 and how the chapters of the dissertation map to publica-
tions and released artifacts in Section 1.6
