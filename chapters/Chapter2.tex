\label{SOTA}


\section{\Wasm}

\subsection{Roadmap}
\todo{Talk about the current roadmap. Components for \Wasm. Polyglot inter process}

\subsection{WebAssembly toolchains}
\todo{Mention, stress the landscape of tools that involve Wasm. Include analysis tools, fuzzers, optimizers and malware detectors.}

\todo{End up motivating the need of Software Diversification for: testing and reliability.}

\section{Software diversification}

\section{Generating Software Diversification}

\subsection{Variants generation}

\subsection{Variants equivalence}

\subsection{Variants preservation}

\todo{We stress here our contributions with a new metric: variants preservation. We strees somehow that it is overlooked. Diversification, despite the stage at which is applied, for WebAssembly needs to go through a preservation study.}
