\lettrine[lines=4]{T}{he} process of generating WebAssembly binaries starts with the original source code, which is then processed by a compiler to produce a \Wasm binary. 
This compiler is generally divided into three main components: a frontend that converts the source code into an intermediate representation, an optimizer that transforms this representation usually for performance, and a backend that compiles the final \Wasm binary. 
For example, LLVM uses this architecture \cite{llvmofficialweb}, supporting several programming languages like C, C++, and Rust for several backed architectures, including \Wasm.


On the other hand, Software Diversification, a preemptive security measure, can be integrated at various stages of this compilation process. 
However, applying diversification at the front-end has its limitations, as it would need a unique diversification mechanism for each language compatible with the frontend component. 
Conversely, diversification at later compiler stages, such as the optimizer or backend, offers a more practical alternative.

Significantly, a study by Hilbig et al. reveals that 70\% of \Wasm binaries are generated using LLVM-based compilers. 
This makes the latter stages of the LLVM compiler an ideal point for introducing practical \wasm diversification techniques. 
Thus, our compiler-based strategies, represented in red and green in \autoref{fig:approach_landscape}, introduce a diversifier component into the LLVM pipeline. 
This component generates LLVM IR variants, thereby creating artificial software diversity for \Wasm. 
Specifically, we propose two tools: CROW, which generates \Wasm program variants, and MEWE, which packages these variants to enable multivariant execution \cite{cox06}.
Alternatively, diversification can be directly applied to the \Wasm binary, offering a language and compiler-agnostic approach. 
Our binary-based strategy, WASM-MUTATE, represented in blue in \autoref{fig:approach_landscape}, employs rewriting rules on an e-graph data structure to generate a variety of \Wasm program variants.

This dissertation contributes to the field of Software Diversification for \Wasm by presenting two primary strategies: compiler-based and binary-based. 
Within this chapter, we introduce three technical contributions: CROW, MEWE, and WASM-MUTATE.
We also compare these contributions, highlighting their complementary nature.
Additionally, we provide the artifacts for our contributions to promote open research and reproducibility of our main takeaways.
