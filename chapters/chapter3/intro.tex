%msection{Generating Software Diversification for WebAssembly}

\Wasm programs are produced ahead of time through a process that begins with the source code of the program and moves through a compiler, resulting in a \Wasm program. 
Software Diversification can be achieved at any of these stages. 
Diversifying at the source code stage, however, is not practical due to the need of creating a distinct diversifier for each language compatible with \Wasm. 
In contrast, focusing on the compiler stage presents a viable option, especially considering that 70\% of \Wasm binaries are created using LLVM-based compilers, as noted by Hilbig et al. \cite{Hilbig2021AnES}. 
Furthermore, implementing diversification at the \Wasm program stage stands as the most generic strategy, applicable to any \Wasm program in the wild. 
Therefore, this thesis focuses on the exploration of diversification strategies at the compiler and \Wasm program stages, employing two main approaches: compiler-based and binary-based.

% Compiler based approaches
Our compiler-based strategies are highlighted in red and green in \autoref{fig:approach_landscape}. 
This approach introduces a diversifier component in the LLVM pipeline, generating LLVM IR variants and producing artificial software diversity for \wasm. 
This strategy encompasses two tools: CROW \cite{CROW}, which creates \wasm program variants, and MEWE \cite{MEWE}, which merges these variants to provide multivariant execution for \wasm.
In contrast, the binary-based strategy, illustrated in blue in \autoref{fig:approach_landscape}, offers diversification for any \Wasm program, removing the need for compiler tuning. 
WASM-MUTATE \cite{wasmmutate} generates a pool of \Wasm program variants through rewriting rules upon an e-graph \cite{e-graph} data structure.


This dissertation contributes to the field of Software Diversification for \Wasm, presenting three main technical contributions: CROW, MEWE, and WASM-MUTATE, dissected upon in the subsequent sections.
Moreover, we compare our technical contributions between them.
Furthermore, we outline the artifacts for our three technical contributions for the sake of open-research and reproducibility.
